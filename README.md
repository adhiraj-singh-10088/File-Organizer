# File-Organizer
simple file organizer with a basic UI

This is a simple project which uses shutil, os, json, and tkinter to bring together a file organizer which sorts files from a source directory to a target directory, sorting different types of files such as images, videos, documents, setup files into their own folders, having an others folder to store files with unknown extension.

It also has a simple UI built from tkinter and stores previously inputted source and destination directories using json.
